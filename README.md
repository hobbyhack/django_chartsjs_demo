# django_chartsjs_demo
This is for quick a quick and simple dashboard. This is not ieal for anything in productions.  
But this is useful to quickly get some charts published with django using pandas to manipulate the data.
This could be modified for use in production.  The main taks would be to generate the right database 
queries to avoid having pandas in the middle of everything.  However, the pandas pivot tables just made
this to easy to pass up for a quick dashboard.
