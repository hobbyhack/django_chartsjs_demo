# django_chartsjs_demo
This is for a quick and simple dashboard. This is not ideal for anything in production.  
But this is useful to quickly get some charts published with django using pandas to manipulate the data.
This could be modified for use in production.  The main task would be to generate the right database 
queries to avoid having pandas in the middle of everything.  However, the pandas pivot tables just made
this to easy too pass up for a quick dashboard.
